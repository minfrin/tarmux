.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tardemux
[\fI\,-f streamname\/\fR] [\fI\,-a\/\fR] [\fI\,file1\/\fR] [\fI\,file2\/\fR] [...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This tool demultiplexes streams that have been multiplexed by the
tarmux tool. It expects a series of tar files containing sparse file
fragments that are unpacked and written to form the original stream.
.PP
In the simplest form, tardemux reads a stream from stdin, unpacks the
stream and writes the first stream to stdout, leaving additional data
intact. This allows tardemux to be run again to extract a further
stream.
.PP
If file parameters are specified, the stream is expected to contain
entries matching these files parameters. The fragments will be unpacked
and written to the given paths.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR name, \fB\-\-file\fR=\fI\,name\/\fR
The name of the input files from which tar
streams will be read, defaults to stdin. Can be specified more
than once.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR
Treat the incoming stream as a raw compressed stream rather
than a tar stream.
.TP
[file1] [...]
Optional files/pipes expected in the tar stream.
Data will be demultiplexed and written to each file/pipe. If this
file/pipe exists, data will be written to the existing file.
