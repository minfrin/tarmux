.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
This tool multiplexes streams such that they may be combined on one
system and then split apart on another. It does so by wrapping each
stream in a series of tar files, each tar file representing a sparse
fragment of the original stream, creating a tar stream.
.PP
In the simplest form, tarmux reads data from stdin, and then outputs
the tar stream to stdout. The corresponding tardemux command reverses
this process by reading to the end of the tar stream, but no further.
This allows streams to be concatenated and later separated from one
another.
.PP
If file parameters are specified, data is read from each file concurrently
and added to the tar stream. If pipe parameters are specified, data
can be read and multiplexed from other processes. When multiple file or
pipe parameters are specified, data is read concurrently and interleaved
until the last file or pipe has closed.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR name, \fB\-\-file\fR=\fI\,name\/\fR
The name of the output file to which tar
streams will be appended, defaults to stdout.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR pathname, \fB\-\-name\fR=\fI\,pathname\/\fR
The pathname to embed in the tar
files when the input is stdin. Defaults to '\-'.
.TP
[file1] [...]
Optional files/pipes whose content will be included in
the tar stream. Regardless of the type of source, data is
embedded as a regular file in the tar stream.
